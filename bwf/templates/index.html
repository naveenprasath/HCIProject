		<h1>Why Bills with friends?</h1>

		<br>
		<h1>The story behind this project</h1>
		<h3>We group of 4 Graduate Students. It was Human Computer Interaction course. The professor asked us to </h3>
		<h3>implement an application with our own idea. We came up with an idea of building a mobile/ Web        </h3>
		<h3>application to organize the bills with our friends. Consider there are 4 friend stays together. They </h3>
		<h3>go to movies, restaurants buys groceries and even takes trips together. They want to track how much  </h3>
		<h3>each spends, so that the other guys owes him back. There are few apps in market.But they are not very</h3>
		<h3>good. I want to make a improved version with many visualizations. With this app, we can store small  </h3>
		<h3>description of the bill (which includes event name, location, date and time), split the bill among 4 </h3>
		<h3>and gives a graphical representation of records in the form of chart, graph, etc.					 </h3>
